# Variables

## Globals

- Any variable declared outside of a function belongs to the global scope
- Global object. In the case of browser code, `window` is the global object.
- Global environment consists of:
    - Object environment record (var, functions)
    - Declarative environment record (const, let, classes)
- Global scope is outermost scope
- The outer reference to the global environment is `null`

## Camel Case

## Strict Mode

- Must be declared like a string at the top of the script or at the beginning of a function
